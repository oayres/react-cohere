## üîç Overview

`react-ssr` is a simple and lightweight React server-side rendering solution that abstracts the complexities of server-side rendering React applications away from the codebase. `react-ssr` adds another optional 'lifecycle' method to your components for fetching data.

## ‚è≥ Installation

```sh
$ npm install react-ssr --save
```

We recommend you use [the babel plugin](https://github.com/oayres/babel-plugin-react-ssr#readme) too. Add the babel plugin to your `.babelrc`.
```sh
$ npm install babel-plugin-react-ssr --save-dev
```
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "react-ssr"
  ]
}
```

You'll also need React 16.3 or higher and React Router 4. They're peerDependencies, obvs.

## üëã Getting started

Hopefully you can get a simple page server-rendering in minutes. Efficiently. Here's everything you need to know.

**Learn quicker by example?** [Check the sample app out](https://github.com/oayres/react-ssr-sample).

### 1. Setting up the server

Assuming you have a simple express server setup, you'll just need to hand off your routes to react-ssr. Note that you can also pass a custom template that will be responsible for the 'HTML document' that wraps your React app. Copy the example from [src/components/DefaultTemplate](https://github.com/oayres/react-ssr/blob/master/src/components/DefaultTemplate/DefaultTemplate.js) as a starting point.

```js
import express from 'express'
import ssr from 'react-ssr'
import routes from './routes'

const app = express()
const renderer = ssr({
  routes: routes
})

app.get('/*', renderer)
app.listen(8000)
```

### 2. Setting up the routes

You will need an array of static routes, which means each route will be an object (as per React Router v4's docs) and not a `<Route />`. This is because a `<Route />` can only be read once rendering begins. A static route can be matched against before rendering begins.

```js
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage'
import NotFoundPage from './pages/NotFoundPage'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    exact: true,
    component: HomePage
  },
  {
    path: '**',
    component: NotFoundPage
  }
]
```

Check out [data loading with server side rendering in React Router v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/server-rendering) to see other comments or examples.

Additionally, your React app entry point will need to *hydrate* those routes out, for example: -
```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import BrowserRouter from 'react-router-dom/BrowserRouter'
import { renderRoutes } from 'react-router-config'
import routes from './routes'

const App = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    {renderRoutes(routes)}
  </BrowserRouter>
)

ReactDOM.hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

### 3. Fetching data

There's one important rule: If you want to make a data call, and you'd like it to be server side rendered correctly, you'll need a static `fetchData` method. `react-ssr` will execute this before it begins rendering your app on the server and inject the result of it into the components props.

_Heads up! We're using the static keyword below. You'll need to add [the transform class properties babel plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) or another alternative to use this at the time of writing._

Here's an example:
```js
class Navigation extends React.Component {
  static fetchData ({req, res, match}) {
    if (req && req.thing) {
      res.redirect() // you can redirect the request
    }

    return {
      content: axios.get('/api/navigation') // becomes available as this.props.content
    }
  }

  render () {
    if (this.props.loading) {
      // react-ssr is calling fetchData client-side
      return <p>loading...</p>
    }

    if (this.props.error) {
      // react-ssr encountered an error calling your fetchData
      return <p>Fancy retry fetch UI...</p>
    }

    console.log(this.props.content)
    return <span />
  }
}

// alternative syntax...
Navigation.fetchData = ({req, res, match}) => {
  return {
    content: axios.get('/api/navigation') // becomes available as this.props.content
  }
}

// only one data call? you can spread out the result into props...
Navigation.fetchData = ({req, res, match}) => {
  return axios.get('/api/navigation') // becomes available as this.props[x], where x is every key returned in top of json tree response from this api call
}
```

üèÜ You should now have server-side rendering setup with asynchronous data calls.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Options

There's two things to know in this section: arguments to `fetchData` and options for `react-ssr`.

### Arguments to fetchData

```js
static fetchData ({req, res, match, isServerRender}) {}
```

| Argument        | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| req             | Node JS request object, server side only                    |
| res             | Node JS response object, server side only                   |
| match           | React route that was matched, contains params               |
| isServerRender  | Shorthand boolean to know if executed from client or server |

### Configuration for react-ssr

```js
import ssr from 'react-ssr'
const renderer = ssr({
  routes: [],
  disable: false,
  ignore: [
    '/example/route' // sends route without ssr if matched
  ],
  cache: { // currently experimental - only accepts redis as a store
    mode: 'full|none', // full means entire page is cached
    duration: 1800, // cache duration in seconds, will rerender and set it again after this time for a given route
    redisClient: null, // optional redisClient - ioredis or node_redis - to use redis as store
    keyPrefix: '', // prefix to prepend to your redis cache keys, which is req.url by default, can be set inline
    keySuffix: '', // suffix to append to your redis cache keys, can be set inline
  }
})
```

You can change your cache policy on-the-fly using middleware and also set the cache key suffix on-the-fly using middleware. This can be useful when you need flexibility on whether to cache or require a unique key based on feature flags being enabled on a given route, for example.

```
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (userIsLoggedIn) {
    res.locals.useSsrCacheForRequest = false
  }

  res.locals.ssrCacheKeyPrefix = 'tyrion' // redis key will now be `tyrion${req.url}`
  res.locals.ssrCacheKeySuffix = 'drogon' // redis key will now be `tyrion${req.url}drogon` for given request
})
app.use(renderer)
```

| Option        | Description                                           | Required | Default                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| routes        | static routes array of your react app                 | yes      | []                                         |
| disable       | disables server-side rendering                        | no       | false                                      |
| ignore        | array of route paths to skip SSR, just send document  | no       | false                                      |
| Html          | override core html document template                  | no       | see src/components/DefaultTemplate in repo |
| Providers     | wraps your routes, useful for context providers, etc  | no       |                                            |
| cache         | allows caching of components or pages                 | no       | { mode: 'none', duration: 1800 }           |

## üì∞ Notes

As data fetching occurs before rendering begins, you should consider:

- Components that are dynamically rendered with static `fetchData` will not be server-side rendered. So, if you're programatically doing something like the below, it will render with `this.props.loading` as true on the client, then fetch the data and rerender:
```jsx
const DynamicComponent = components['MyComponent']
return <DynamicComponent />
```

### No babel plugin?

Two simple steps should be taken if you're giving that a skip, but we recommend you use it to abstract this nonsense away from your codebase. If you'd like an alternative, raise an issue or a PR :-)
